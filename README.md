# Reverse Hackathon 2026 — Mission Deck

Registration site for the Reverse Hackathon 2026, run by **The Whitehatians**, Department of
Cyber Security, SRM Valliammai Engineering College. A three-hour defensive sprint: teams receive an
already-built, deliberately vulnerable system and must find, patch and defend the fixes.

**Live site:** <https://reverse-hackthon2k26.vercel.app/>

## What is in this repo

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `index.html` | Main public landing/registration page — markup, CSS and JS in one file. |
| `user.html` | Participant team workspace: password sign-in, problem/solution editing and read-only mark. |
| `admin.html` | Organiser dashboard. Asks for `ADMIN_KEY`, reviews submissions, records marks and downloads Excel. |
| `hero-bg.jpg`, `superman-hero.jpg`, `about-bg.jpg`, `standards-bg.jpg`, `dc-contact-art.jpg`, `dc-contact-clear.jpg` / `.webp` / `.avif`, `srm-valliammai-logo.jpg`, `assets/superman-hero.png` / `.webp` / `.avif` | Section backgrounds and art. Modern browsers use the smaller AVIF/WebP variants; original files remain as fallbacks. |
| `assets/villains/` | The 15 gallery cards, downloaded from the old CDN so the site no longer depends on a third-party host. |
| `og-deck.png` | Open Graph preview image. |
| `api/` | Vercel serverless functions (Node). Registration, team authentication/workspace, and organiser APIs. |
| `scripts/check-site.mjs` | Pre-deploy check. Run it before every deploy. |
| `dev-host.cjs` | Local-only helper that serves the static site and runs `api/` without Vercel. |
| `src/`, `next.config.mjs`, `tailwind.config.ts` | An older Next.js draft with a different theme. **Not deployed** — see "Legacy files" below. |

The site is static HTML pages plus serverless functions. There is no build step for the front end,
and no framework.

## Event facts

- **Date:** Tuesday, 13 October 2026, 09:00 IST (gates 08:00, ledger closes 07:00)
- **Format:** Solo or Duo; a Duo is one team lead plus exactly one partner (no larger teams)
- **Eligibility:** DEP-CYS students, years I–III
- **Entry fee:** None. Registration is free; no payment or receipt is required.

The date lives in six places inside `index.html` — meta description, the `content:` string in
`.landing-art-frame::after`, the hero date line, the "ENTRY STATUS" badge, the contact block, and
`EVENT_TIME` for the countdown. Change all six together.

## Tech

- Static HTML/CSS/vanilla JS, jQuery only for the small chat widget
- Vercel serverless functions (Node 18+, CommonJS)
- MongoDB Atlas (free M0 tier) via the official `mongodb` driver
- ExcelJS for the `.xlsx` export
- No bundler, no transpiler, no framework runtime

## Environment variables

Set these in **Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables** (and in `.env.local` for local work).
See `.env.example`. Never commit real values.

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT` | Gmail SMTP (`smtp.gmail.com`, `465`) |
| `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS` | Mailbox + **App Password** (see below) |
| `MAIL_FROM` | Optional display sender. Defaults to `SMTP_USER` |
| `MAIL_NOTIFY_TO` | Optional. Comma-separated. CC/BCC yourself on every confirmation |
| `MONGODB_URI` | Atlas connection string, e.g. `mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net` |
| `MONGODB_DB` | Database name (default `reversehack2026`) |
| `ADMIN_KEY` | Long random string that unlocks `/admin.html` and every `/api/admin/*` route |
| `TEAM_SESSION_SECRET` | Optional long random secret for signing team sessions; if unset, a domain-separated key is derived from `ADMIN_KEY` |

Generate a key with:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(24).toString('hex'))"
```

> **Gmail needs an App Password, not your account password.** If 2-Step Verification is on (and it
> should be), the real password is rejected by `smtp.gmail.com`. Go to
> <https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords>, generate a 16-character App Password, and paste that
> into `SMTP_PASS`. Port 465 with `secure: true` is already handled.

Confirmation mail is sent **after** the registration is committed to MongoDB and the response is
built, so an SMTP outage can never lose an entry. If mail fails the registration still succeeds and
the response reports `"emailSent": false`.

### Creating the free MongoDB cluster

1. Sign up at <https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/register> and choose the free **M0** tier.
2. **Create a deployment** — region closest to the college (Chennai), free tier.
3. **Database Access** → *Add New Database User* → set a username and password → role
   **Read and write to any database**.
4. **Network Access** → *Add IP Address*. Vercel Functions use dynamic outbound addresses by
   default, so a single workstation IP will not reliably allow a production connection. For a
   production database, use a stable egress option such as [Vercel Static IPs](https://vercel.com/docs/networking/static-ips)
   where the team's plan supports it. Avoid `0.0.0.0/0` unless you deliberately accept the
   expanded exposure; it allows connection attempts from every public IP.
5. **Deploy** → green **Connect** button → **Drivers** → copy the connection string.

No manual collection setup is needed: `api/_lib.js` creates the indexes on first write, including
a unique index on the lowercased team name / Solo alias and another on participant emails.

> M0 free tier is **5 GB shared across the whole cluster** and caps a document at 16 MB. Keep
> registration records concise; do not store large media files in the database.

## Registration (free)

Registration is free; no UPI payment, transaction ID, receipt, or proof is required. `api/_lib.js`
is the server-side validation source of truth, and the page mirrors field errors onto the matching input.

The form collects the entry format (Solo or Duo), a unique team name or Solo alias, a required
8–72-character team-workspace password, and the primary participant's name, email, phone, year,
department, gender and register number. Duo entries also require the partner's name, year and
register number. Every entry includes one of 15 domains, how the participant heard about the event,
and agreement to the rules. On success, the team name and password are shown once; the password is
not emailed, exported, or returned by later APIs.

## Participant team workspace

Teams can open `/user.html` and sign in with their team name / Solo alias and registration password.
The server stores only a salted scrypt hash, and the browser receives a signed, HttpOnly, Secure-on-
Vercel, SameSite=Lax cookie that expires after seven days. Team endpoints return only that team's
workspace-safe information. Teams can save a problem statement (up to 5,000 characters) and solution
(up to 8,000 characters). A score entered by an organiser is visible but cannot be changed by the team.

The confirmation page shows the new password once. It cannot be recovered from the database or
organiser dashboard. If a password is lost, contact the event organisers rather than sharing secrets
through chat.

### API

| Route | Method | Auth | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/api/register` | POST | none | Store one free registration. `201`, or `400` with `fieldErrors`, `409` on duplicate team/email, `403` after the deadline, `503` if Mongo is unreachable. |
| `/api/auth/login` | POST | Team name + password | Verify a team credential and issue an HttpOnly session cookie. |
| `/api/auth/logout` | POST | Team session | Expire the team session cookie. |
| `/api/team/me` | GET | Team session | Return the signed-in team's profile, workspace content and read-only mark. |
| `/api/team/submit` | POST | Team session | Save only the problem statement and solution for the signed-in team. |
| `/api/admin/registrations` | GET | `x-admin-key` | Registration details and totals including submissions and marks; authentication secrets are excluded. |
| `/api/admin/marks` | PATCH | `x-admin-key` | Set or clear an integer mark from 0 to 100. |
| `/api/admin/export` | GET | `x-admin-key` | Streams a styled `.xlsx` with registration, submission, score and summary sheets/columns; authentication secrets are excluded. |

The admin key is compared with `crypto.timingSafeEqual`, so it cannot be probed byte by byte.

## Organiser dashboard

Open `/admin.html`, paste the `ADMIN_KEY`, and the dashboard shows registrations, participants,
submissions and marked teams. Organisers can review problem statements and solutions, set or clear a
0–100 mark, filter the table, and download a workbook with three sheets:

- **Participants** — one row per human. This is what the check-in desk wants.
- **Registrations** — one row per entry, with problem statement, solution, mark and update timestamps.
- **Summary** — event, registration, submission and mark totals; no fee reconciliation is included.

The key is held in `sessionStorage`, so it disappears when the tab closes.

For direct database inspection, sign in to MongoDB Atlas and open **Data Explorer** → the database
selected by `MONGODB_DB` (defaults to `reversehack2026` if unset) → the `registrations` collection.
The website admin key and Atlas database credentials are separate; keep `MONGODB_URI` private.

## Local development

There is nothing to build. To browse the site:

```bash
python -m http.server 8080     # or any static server
```

The API needs Node, so use the bundled helper or `vercel dev`:

```bash
npm install
# terminal 1 - static site + api/ on http://localhost:3100
set MONGODB_URI=...&& set ADMIN_KEY=...&& node dev-host.cjs
# or, with the Vercel CLI (closest to production):
npx vercel dev
```

`vercel dev` is the better option because it runs the functions exactly as Vercel will.

## Deploy

`vercel.json` pins `framework: null` so Vercel serves `index.html` as a static file and does **not**
try to build the leftover Next.js app. Keep the project's Framework Preset on **Other**.

1. Push the repo.
2. Vercel → **New Project** → import → preset **Other**.
3. Add `MONGODB_URI`, `MONGODB_DB` and `ADMIN_KEY` under **Environment Variables**.
4. Deploy. `/`, `/admin.html` and `/api/*` all work immediately.

## Before you go live

1. **Confirm the free-entry policy** remains accurate in the registration form, confirmation email,
   and event announcement; do not add UPI, transaction IDs, payment screenshots, or proof uploads.
2. **Confirm the date** in all six places listed above.
3. **Set `ADMIN_KEY`** to a real secret. Do not reuse the local value.
4. **Contact email.** `CONTACT_EMAIL` in `index.html` is still
   `registration@whitehatians.in`. The confirmation mailto button uses it. Change it to the
   organiser mailbox (`SMTP_USER`) so replies land in the same inbox.
5. Proofread the domain list and schedule against your announcement.

## Deploy checklist

```bash
npm install
npm run check        # assets, inline JS, tags, ids, dates, branding, secrets
```

`npm run check` exits non-zero on any problem and is the fastest way to catch a missing image or a
leftover reference before you push.

## Legacy files

`src/`, `next.config.mjs`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.mjs`, `tsconfig.json` and
`future-of-creative-ai-summit.html` are from an earlier Next.js draft with a different theme. The
deployed site does not use them and `vercel.json` prevents Vercel from building them. Delete them
once you are comfortable — but note `npm run dev` currently starts that old app, not this site.
